# ToolBox

Im writing this as I go, May take a bit to get the full documentation down. I only have so much of an attention span...


This is a program that I have made to easier get to settings.<br/>

Once started the program sits in the task tray as a green check mark.<br/>
Left click the icon to bring up a menu where you can access some menu choices<br/>
**Open Toolbox** - opens the main program<br/>
**Task manager** - Opens task manager in a non elivated mode<br/>
**Close toolbox** - Shuts the program down<br/>
**Restart** - Opens a dialog box to conferm the restart, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until restart starts<br/>
**Shutdown** - Opens a dialog box to conferm the shutdown, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until Shutdown starts<br/>
