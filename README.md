# ToolBox

Im writing this as I go, May take a bit to get the full documentation down. I only have so much of an attention span...


This is a program that I have made to easier get to settings.

Once started the program sits in the task tray as a green check mark.
Left click the icon to bring up a menu where you can access some menu choices

Open Toolbox - opens the main program

Task manager - Opens task manager in a non elivated mode

Close toolbox - Shuts the program down

Restart - Opens a dialog box to conferm the restart, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until restart starts

Shutdown - Opens a dialog box to conferm the shutdown, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until Shutdown starts
