# ToolBox

Im writing this as I go, May take a bit to get the full documentation down. I only have so much of an attention span...


This is a program that I have made to easier get to settings.<br/>

Once started the program sits in the task tray as a green check mark.<br/>
Left click the icon to bring up a menu where you can access some menu choices<br/>
<\t> Note this may take one or two tries when first launched. Trying to figure out why that is.<br/>
**Open Toolbox** - opens the main program<br/>
**Task manager** - Opens task manager in a non elivated mode<br/>
**Close toolbox** - Shuts the program down<br/>
**Restart** - Opens a dialog box to conferm the restart, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until restart starts<br/>
**Shutdown** - Opens a dialog box to conferm the shutdown, Once pressed, it will take 10 seconds until Shutdown starts<br/>
<br/>
The main program lets you easaly access programs, settings, and features with one button click.<br/>
Some of the programs are hard to get to in Windows 10, the main reason for this program.<br/>
For example: The old Sound settings, Network and Sharing Center, Network Addapters, Control Panel, and Programs and features (Uninstall).<br/>
The main program also has buttons for Restarting, Shutting down, and Shutdown Toolbox. These buttons act the same as the tray icon buttons do.<br/>
<br/>
Double click on the tray icon to bring up the System Information window.<br/>
This window is divided into 6 areas.<br/>
**First is the CPU load and Memory Usage:**<br/>
This will show the current CPU load according to windows and Memory used / total memory.<br/>
**Second is CPU information:<br/>**
Here you can find the CPU name, Number of cores and threads, Status, System name, and the model of the computer. The model will show the manufacure of the system ie: Dell, HP, or if custom built.<br/>
**Third is Motherboard information:<br/>**
Motherboard Manufacturer, Product, Serial Number, Bios version, and Bios release date.<br/>
**Forth is Windows Informaiton:<br/>**
Windows Edition, Acrhitecture, Build number, Install date, Last boot, and Uptime.<br/>
**Fifth is Network information:<br/>**
This pulls all network addapters on the computer.<br/>
for adapters that are up, this will show the adapter name, rated speed, ip, subnet mask, and default gateway.<br/>
For adapters that are down, it will show the adapter name and the stat of the adapter (down).<br/>
**Sixth is GPU Informaiton:<br/>**
This pulls basic information about your GPU.<br/>
GPU name, Video Processor, Driver version, and Driver date.<br/>
For laptops, this will show both integrated and discrete GPUs.<br/>
For Laptos the GPU name will be the integrated GPU. THe Display will show the discrete GPU. At least is should...<br/>
